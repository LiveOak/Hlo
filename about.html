						<p>I am an Assistant Professor of Research at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, and I typically have an additional two or three consulting projects.  The time required by my faculty position depends on my outside projects and varies between .5 and .8 full-time employment (I am fortunate to have standing offers from two research studies to hire me for as many hours as I can give them).  I like having a few outside projects because they typically pay better and they expose new challenges.  I started a (one-person) consulting company before graduate school, and have had contracts for 10-20 hours per week since then.  If you’d like more background, feel free to ask.</p>
						<p>I am very comfortable with Bayesian statistics –my generals focused on this topic, and I’ve used Bayesian methods to estimate models in environmental microbiology, medical decision making, cognitive psychology, and epidemic transmission of social activities. I’ve written several articles and chapters on simulation methods (MCMCs and bootstrapping). Perhaps my biggest strength is exploratory and graphing data analysis. I compiled a collection of my graphs to use when I teach graphing workshops; I’d be happy to email it if you’d like to see some type of portfolio.</p>
						<p>My programming abilities are as strong as most professional software developers.  I’ve developed: (a) four clinical databases with a SQL Server backend and C# middle and client tiers, (b) massive parallel statistical simulations, (c) medical decision making training aids, and (d) at least a dozen systems that manipulate and merge multiple data sources to produce real-time graphics and reporting.  For these types of projects, I use many agile and TDD approaches.  Regarding Linux, I use OU’s supercomputer (which runs Red Hat) for spatial analyses.</p>
						<p>My preferred statistical tool is 
						<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>, and I have used it almost exclusively since 2006 (although I have taught courses and labs with SAS and SPSS).    I’ve developed 
						<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NlsyLinks/">one</a> R package and have taught many programming and graphing workshops in R.  The appeal of literate programming and reproducible research prompted me to manage my R projects in
						<a href="https://github.com/wibeasley">GitHub</a> and 
						<a href="https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/nlsylinks/">R-Forge</a> and to use 
						<a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a>/<a href="http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/">Sweave</a>/<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> for reports.  R’s reporting ecosystem has allowed me to communicate better with a new audience (specifically, policy makers and politicians in the past two years), who have good brains, but not necessarily any statistical training.</p>
						<p>A list of my publications can be found at
						<a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ffsJTC0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">
						Google Scholar</a>.&nbsp; Additional career information 
						is listed on
						<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Beasley2/">
