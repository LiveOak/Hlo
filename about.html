						<p>I started Howard Live Oak in 2003 to facilitate 
						my interests in statistical analysis and research 
						methodology. After graduating Davidson College in 2000 
						with a Psychology major and a Neuroscience concentration, I became increasingly attracted to 
						research; meanwhile I was involved in several studies with interesting software development 
						challenges. We have had continuous funding and contracts 
						since our company was founded, and almost all have involved a 
						blend of statistics and software.</p>
						<p>I attended the <a href="http://www.ou.edu/cas/psychology/Research/Quantitative.html">
						Quantitative Psychology</a> graduate program at the University of 
						Oklahoma, Norman (2003-2010) and subsequently accepted an
						<a href="http://find.ouhsc.edu/Faculty.aspx?FacultyID=1064">
						assistant research faculty position</a> at the University 
						of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City. The time 
						required by my faculty position depends on my 
						<a href="http://howardliveoak.com">Howard Live Oak</a> 
						projects and varies between .5 and .8 full-time 
						employment (I am fortunate to have standing offers from 
						two research studies to hire me for as many hours as I 
						can give them). I prefer to limit my outside projects 
						because they expose new challenges, and I give extraordinary attention to each one. If you’d like more 
						background, feel free to ask.</p>
						<p>I embrace both Bayesian and Frequentist statistics –a 
						great deal of past work focused on 
						Bayesian methods to estimate models in clinical 
						research, environmental microbiology, medical decision making, cognitive psychology, 
						and epidemic transmission of social activities. I’ve written several articles and chapters on simulation methods (MCMCs and bootstrapping). 
						Perhaps my biggest strength is exploratory and graphical data analysis. I 
						have compiled a collection of my graphs to use when I teach graphing workshops 
						that I'll be happy to distribute by email upon request.</p>						
						<p>My programming abilities are as strong as most professional software developers.  I’ve developed: (a) four clinical databases with a SQL Server 
						backend and C# middle and client tiers, (b) massive parallel statistical simulations, (c) medical decision making training aids, and (d) at least a
						dozen systems that manipulate and merge multiple data sources to produce real-time graphics and reporting.  For these types of projects, I use 
						several agile and TDD approaches.  Regarding Linux, I use OU’s supercomputer (which runs Red Hat) for spatial analyses.</p>
						<p>My preferred statistical tool is 
						<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>, and I have used it 
						extensively since 2005 (I have also taught courses and 
						workshops with SAS and SPSS).    I’ve developed 
						one R package (<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NlsyLinks/">NlsyLinks</a>) and have taught many programming 
						and graphing workshops in R.  The appeal of literate programming and reproducible research prompted me to manage my R projects in
						<a href="https://github.com/wibeasley">GitHub</a> and 
						<a href="https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/nlsylinks/">R-Forge</a> and to use 
						<a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a>/<a href="http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/">Sweave</a>/
						<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> for reports.  R’s reporting ecosystem has allowed me to communicate better 
						with a new audience (specifically, policy makers and politicians in the past two years), 
						who have relatively limited statistical training.</p>

						<p>A list of my publications can be found at
						<a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ffsJTC0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">
						Google Scholar</a>. Additional information 
						is available on
						<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Beasley2/">
						LinkedIn</a> and
