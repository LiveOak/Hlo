						<p>I started Howard Live Oak in 2003 to facilitate 
						my interest in statistical analysis and research 
						methodology. After graduating Davidson College in 
						2000 with a major in Psychology and a concentration in 
						Neuroscience, I became increasingly interested in 
						research; meanwhile I was involved in several studies with interesting software development 
						challenges.&nbsp; Almost all my projects since have 
						involved a blend of statistics and software.&nbsp; I 
						graduated from the
						<a href="http://www.ou.edu/cas/psychology/Research/Quantitative.html">
						Quantitative Psychology</a> program at the University of 
						Oklahoma, Norman in 2010 and subsequently accepted an 
						assistant faculty position athe University of Oklahoma 
						Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City.</p>
						<p>I embrace both Bayesian and Frequentist statistics –a 
						great deal of past work focused on 
						Bayesian methods to estimate models in environmental microbiology, medical decision making, cognitive psychology, 
						and epidemic transmission of social activities. I’ve written several articles and chapters on simulation methods (MCMCs and bootstrapping). 
						Perhaps my biggest strength is exploratory and graphical data analysis. I 
						have compiled a collection of my graphs to use when I teach graphing workshops 
						that I'll be happy to distribute by email upon request.</p>
						
						<p>My programming abilities are as strong as most professional software developers.  I’ve developed: (a) four clinical databases with a SQL Server 
						backend and C# middle and client tiers, (b) massive parallel statistical simulations, (c) medical decision making training aids, and (d) at least a
						 dozen systems that manipulate and merge multiple data sources to produce real-time graphics and reporting.  For these types of projects, I use many
						  agile and TDD approaches.  Regarding Linux, I use OU’s supercomputer (which runs Red Hat) for spatial analyses.</p>
						
						<p>My preferred statistical tool is 
						<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>, and I have used it 
						extensively since 2006 (I have also taught courses and 
						workshops with SAS and SPSS).    I’ve developed 
						one R package (<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NlsyLinks/">NlsyLinks</a>) and have taught many programming 
						and graphing workshops in R.  The appeal of literate programming and reproducible research prompted me to manage my R projects in
						<a href="https://github.com/wibeasley">GitHub</a> and 
						<a href="https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/nlsylinks/">R-Forge</a> and to use 
						<a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a>/<a href="http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/">Sweave</a>/
						<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> for reports.  R’s reporting ecosystem has allowed me to communicate better 
						with a new audience (specifically, policy makers and politicians in the past two years), 
						who have relatively limited statistical training.</p>

						<p>I am an Assistant Professor of Research at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, and typically have an additional two or three 
						consulting projects.  The time required by my faculty position depends on my outside projects and varies between .5 and .8 full-time employment 
						(I am fortunate to have standing offers from two research studies to hire me for as many hours as I can give them).  I 
						prefer to limit my outside projects because I give 
						extraordinary attention to each one, and they expose new challenges.  I started a (one-person) consulting company before graduate school, 
						 and have had contracts for 10-20 hours per week since then.  If you’d like more background, feel free to ask.</p>
						 
						<p>A list of my publications can be found at
						<a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ffsJTC0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">
						Google Scholar</a>. Additional information 
						is available on
						<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Beasley2/">
						LinkedIn</a> and
